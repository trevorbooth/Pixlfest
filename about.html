				    	<h2>History</h2>
					    	<p>We wanted to create a day packed full of information and what better way to do that than invite professionals from Oklahoma to share their expertise.</p>
					    	<p>In 2011 the <a href="http://www.francistuttle.edu/">Francis Tuttle Technology Center</a> Web Design and Development programs from the Edmond Memorial High School, <a href="http://ftclass.com">Rockwell</a> and <a href="http://webclasshelp.com">Online</a> campuses hosted the first conference, Webfest. The first conference hosted over a 100 students. The conference was inspired by the work of Zac Gordon and his Dabrook students at Springbook High School.</p>
					    	<p>Since Webfest was a huge success, we wanted to broaden our horizons, so in 2012 we teamed up with the <a href="http://animatedfuture.com">3D Animation and Visual Effects</a> program to add an animation track. Since Webfest was no longer the right name, we re-branded with Pixlfest. In 2013, we teamed up with the Audio and Video Production program to offer one more track.</p>
					    	<p>In 2014 we expanded once again! The Business Marketing and Management and Graphic Communications programs are now onboard to get even more students involved.</p>
					    	<p>The conference is hosted by Francis Tuttle Technology Center <a href="http://pixlcrew.com/">PIXLCREW</a> students.</p>
